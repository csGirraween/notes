                <h2>1. Overview of the Selective High School Placement Test</h2>
                <p>The Selective High School Placement Test is designed to assess the academic capabilities of students seeking entry into selective high schools in NSW. The test evaluates skills in four key areas:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Reading:</strong> Comprehension and interpretation of written texts.</li>
                    <li><strong>Mathematical Reasoning:</strong> Application of mathematical concepts and problem-solving skills.</li>
                    <li><strong>Thinking Skills:</strong> Critical thinking, logical reasoning, and problem-solving abilities.</li>
                    <li><strong>Writing:</strong> Ability to express ideas effectively in written form.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Each of these components is weighted equally, contributing 25% to the overall placement score.</p>
                
                <h2>2. Test Structure and Timing</h2>
