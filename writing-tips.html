            <h3>Marking Criteria for Selective High School Placement Test Writing Component</h3>
            <p>In Selective, each candidate's writing response is independently evaluated by two trained examiners. Each examiner assigns a score out of 25, and the combined total provides a score out of 50.</p>
            
            <p>The examiners assess responses based on several key aspects:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Content and Relevance:</strong> The degree to which the response addresses the prompt effectively and remains on topic.</li>
                <li><strong>Structure and Organisation:</strong> The clarity and logical flow of ideas, including paragraphing and overall coherence.</li>
                <li><strong>Language Use:</strong> The range and accuracy of vocabulary and sentence structures employed.</li>
                <li><strong>Mechanics:</strong> Correctness in spelling, punctuation, and grammar.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>For illustrative examples of marked responses with examiner comments, refer to the <a href="https://education.nsw.gov.au/content/dam/main-education/public-schools/selective-high-schools-and-opportunity-classes/media/NSW_SHSPT_Writing_Sample_Answers_with_Examiner_Comments.pdf" target="_blank">provided sample answers document</a>.</p>

                        <p>Figurative language involves using words or expressions with meanings different from their literal interpretation to create vivid imagery or emphasise ideas. There are many! But key types include:</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>Metaphor:</strong> A direct comparison between two unrelated things, stating that one thing is another, to suggest they share common characteristics.</p>
                        <p><em>Example:</em> "Time is a thief."</p>
                        <p><em>Explanation:</em> This implies that time stealthily takes away life's moments, much like a thief would steal possessions.</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>Simile:</strong> A comparison between two different things using "like" or "as" to highlight a shared quality.</p>
                        <p><em>Example:</em> "Her smile was as bright as the sun."</p>
                        <p><em>Explanation:</em> This suggests that her smile is exceptionally radiant, comparable to the brightness of the sun.</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>Allusion:</strong> An indirect reference to a person, event, or piece of literature, allowing readers to make connections.</p>
                        <p><em>Example:</em> "He has the Midas touch when it comes to business."</p>
                        <p><em>Explanation:</em> This alludes to King Midas from Greek mythology, implying that everything he handles turns to gold, or is highly successful.</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>Hyperbole:</strong> An intentional exaggeration for emphasis or comedic effect.</p>
                        <p><em>Example:</em> "I've told you a million times."</p>
                        <p><em>Explanation:</em> This emphasises frequent repetition, though not literally a million times.</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>Personification:</strong> Attributing human characteristics to non-human entities or inanimate objects.</p>
                        <p><em>Example:</em> "The wind whispered through the trees."</p>
                        <p><em>Explanation:</em> This gives the wind the human ability to whisper, suggesting a gentle rustling sound.</p>

                    <div class="accordion-content">
                        <p>Persuasive language is used to convince the audience of a particular point of view or to take specific action. Key techniques include:</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>Modality:</strong> Refers to the strength or certainty conveyed by the language, often through modal verbs.</p>
                        <p><em>Example:</em> "We must address climate change immediately."</p>
                        <p><em>Explanation:</em> The use of "must" indicates a high degree of necessity and urgency.</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>Rhetorical Questions:</strong> Questions posed for effect, not requiring an answer, to provoke thought.</p>
                        <p><em>Example:</em> "Isn't it time we took a stand for justice?"</p>
                        <p><em>Explanation:</em> Encourages the audience to agree with the implied assertion that action is overdue.</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>Statistics and Evidence:</strong> Using data and factual information to support an argument.</p>
                        <p><em>Example:</em> "Studies show that 90% of students benefit from regular exercise."</p>
                        <p><em>Explanation:</em> Provides concrete data to substantiate the claim about exercise benefits.</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>Examples:</strong> Specific instances that illustrate a point or support an argument.</p>
                        <p><em>Example:</em> "For instance, countries that have implemented renewable energy have seen economic growth."</p>
                        <p><em>Explanation:</em> Offers a real-world example to back the argument for renewable energy.</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>Anecdotes:</strong> Short, personal stories used to illustrate a point or evoke empathy.</p>
                        <p><em>Example:</em> "When I switched to a plant-based diet, my energy levels soared."</p>
                        <p><em>Explanation:</em> Personal experience used to support the benefits of dietary change.</p>

                    <div class="accordion-content">
                        <p>Emotive language involves word choices that aim to elicit an emotional response from the audience, often to persuade or influence opinions.</p>
                        
                        <p><em>Example:</em> "The innocent children were mercilessly slaughtered."</p>
                        <p><em>Explanation:</em> Words like "innocent" and "mercilessly slaughtered" evoke strong feelings of sympathy and outrage.</p>
                        
                        <p><em>Example:</em> "Join us in this noble cause to uplift the underprivileged."</p>
                        <p><em>Explanation:</em> Words like "noble" and "uplift" inspire a sense of duty and compassion.</p>
