                    <p><strong>Superhero Writing Entry:</strong></p>
                    <p>
                    Dear Movie Team,<br><br>
            
                    I hope this message finds you well, or at least somewhere between the shadows and the spotlight. I’d like to introduce you to a different kind of superhero, one who doesn’t leap buildings or shoot fire from their eyes, but whose power speaks to something far older, far deeper.<br><br>
            
                    Her name is Vesper, not born of lightning, nor of gamma rays, but of silence.<br><br>
            
                    Vesper wears no cape. Her uniform is made of layered dusk, charcoal greys, bruised purples, and the occasional glint of starlight at her collarbone. Her eyes reflect the last light of day, those minutes before nightfall when the world seems to hold its breath. She's not flashy. She doesn't need to be. Her presence bends attention like gravity. A whisper in a world that screams.<br><br>
            
                    Her gift? She listens. Not just to words, but to what’s buried beneath them—fear, truth, pain, longing. In a time where noise drowns everything, she hears what people really mean, even when they don’t know it themselves. With this gift, she uncovers corruption hidden behind polished speeches, halts violence born of misunderstood motives, and stitches together communities through nothing more than presence and perception. She turns conflict into clarity, not by fighting it, but by unraveling it.<br><br>
            
                    Vesper’s motif is the mirror. Not one that flatters, but one that reveals. She holds it up to others and lets them face who they truly are. The villain may think they’re untouchable, but when they look into Vesper’s gaze, they see their consequences. Her symbol isn’t a weapon; it’s reflection. And that’s what makes her dangerous.<br><br>
            
                    Why will people love her? Because Vesper is who we wish we could be when the world becomes too loud. She is quiet strength in an age of noise. She shows that power isn’t always in force, but in understanding. That empathy can be as sharp as a blade. In a market full of high-octane heroes, Vesper offers something more human, more needed.<br><br>
            
                    Thank you for the opportunity. I hope her silence speaks to you.<br><br>
            
                    Warm regards,<br>
